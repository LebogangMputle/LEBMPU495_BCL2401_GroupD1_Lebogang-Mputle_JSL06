# Challenges Faced
1. Dynamic Content Generation
Generating menu items dynamically based on the data structure was challenging. We needed to ensure the code was flexible enough to handle changes in the menu data, such as adding new categories or items.

Solution: We iterated over the object properties using a for...in loop, creating HTML elements on the fly. This approach allows for easy updates to the menu data without needing to adjust the HTML structure manually.

2. Event Handling
Attaching event listeners to dynamically created elements posed a challenge, especially ensuring that the correct item data was passed to the addToOrder function when an item was clicked.

Solution: We used a closure within the .forEach loop to correctly bind the event listener and ensure the right item name was passed to the addToOrder function.

3. Updating the Order Total
Calculating and updating the order total in real-time as users add items required careful management of state and UI updates.

Solution: We maintained a running total of the order and updated the UI each time an item was added. This approach keeps the displayed total in sync with the user's selections.

# Areas for Improvement
1. Dynamic Pricing
The current implementation assumes a fixed price for all menu items, which is unrealistic for a real-world application.

Improvement: Integrate a pricing model into the menu data structure, allowing each item to have its own price. Update the addToOrder function to calculate the total based on actual item prices.

3. Responsiveness
The project's front-end design currently does not account for responsive design principles.

Improvement: Apply responsive web design practices to ensure the menu is usable on devices of all sizes. Improve accessibility by adding appropriate ARIA roles and properties to the dynamically generated elements, ensuring that the website is navigable and usable by people with disabilities.
